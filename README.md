# Road Accident Project
A road accident dashboard was created to explore how various factors caused accidents. 

In this project, different enviroments were analysed to identify how the number of casualties changed depending on the following:

What type of vehicle had the most casualties?
What was the severity of the casualties from 2022 -2023?
What area had the most casualties and was this different each year?
Did a certain road surface cause more casualties than others?
Did the time of day play a factor on the number of casualties?

These important KPIs were created through the use of pivot tables, after the data was cleaned. Similar vehicles in the raw datasheet were grouped together for a cleaner visual experience.
Casualties from 2022 and 2023 were present in the datasheet, which led to the creation of a timeline to identify monthly trends. Furthermore the dashboard was created to find specific information from 2022
and 2023 with multiple filters and the use of relevant graphs for effective visualisation. A data analysis sheet was created to showcase the various pivot tables used to analyse data and hyperlinks were added for seamless 
transition from the data analysis sheet to the dashboard.
